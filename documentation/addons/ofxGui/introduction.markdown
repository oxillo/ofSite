## Simple GUI to easily change parameters in your applications

The classes and functions in this module allow creating simple Graphical User Interfaces. 

A GUI usually consist of one or more panels that contain buttons, sliders, labels and other controls. These controls are normally connected to either a variable or a function. When the user of the application interacts with these controls, the connected variables are updated or functions get called. 

It is recommended to use [ofParameter](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/types/ofParameter/) instead of using these classes directly. See the examples at https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/gui .
