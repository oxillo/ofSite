The documentation is written by users like you that enjoy OF.

### Did you find some incorrect information?

If you are not sure, ask in the forum first. If you want to correct the documentation, in most cases there's a button at the beginning of the page that will bring you to the editor in github. You can also fork the repository, create a separate branch and open a pull request.

### Do you want to contribute to the actual documentation?

That is great!
These are some of the things that we could improve:

* Write a new how-to, improve an existing example or add a new one. Here there is a list of what is needed (https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/wiki/Tutorials%2C-Examples-and-Documentation)
* Add a Readme file for each example alredy existing in the `examples` folder, like in this [example](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/3d/ofNodeExample)
* Fill the modules documentation and classes documentation. Every module and class have their documentation, accessible by clicking on "Module Documentation" on the [documentation page](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation) or the name of each class. If you feel that something important is missing, or it is not well explained, send a fix by following the 'edit module'/'edit class'/'edit functions' links at the beginning of each page. You can find more detailed instructions in the [contributing to the docs how-to](/learning/08_other/contributing)
* Fill function documentation in the source code of the openFrameworks repository, follow the [doxygen styleguide](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/wiki/openFrameworks-doxygen-documentation-style-guidelines).
