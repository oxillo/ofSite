Raspberry Pi
============


## Mount your Raspberry Pi as a hard drive
    
**WARNING: This is a very permissive file sharing configuration that gives you read/write/delete permissions across the entire file system. It is not recommended if you are the least bit concerned about being able to delete important files over a network.**

### Create a mount point
In order to avoid permissions problems in creating, deleting and moving files the following commands create a shortcut to the root file system and mount it as a virtual drive.

* `cd /`
* `sudo -i`
* `mkdir /rootfs`
* `mount --bind / /rootfs`

The following steps will allow the above mount command to run everytime the RPi is rebooted. Otherwise you will have to run it manually

* `sudo nano /etc/fstab`

add the line

    /               /rootfs         none    bind


It should look something like this:

    proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
    /dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
    /dev/mmcblk0p2  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
    /               /rootfs         none    bind
    # a swapfile is not a swap partition, no line here
    #   use  dphys-swapfile swap[on|off]  for that

* Press CTRL+o to save the file
* Press CTRL+x to exit `nano`


### Install Samba
From a Shell run these commands

* `sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin`

The next command will prompt you for a password you will need to remember. Use `raspberry` if you want to keep the default as the pi user's defaults

* `sudo smbpasswd -a pi`
* `sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.old`
* `sudo rm /etc/samba/smb.conf`
* `sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf`

You should now be editing the configuration file. Paste this into it: 

    [global]
	workgroup = HOME
	netbios name = SAMBA
	server string = Samba Server %v
	map to guest = Bad User
	log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
	max log size = 50
	socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
	preferred master = No
	local master = No
	dns proxy = No
	security = User

    # Share
    [Data]
	path = /rootfs
	valid users = pi
	read only = No
	create mask = 0777
	directory mask = 0777

* Press CTRL+o to save the file
* Press CTRL+x to exit `nano`
* `sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart`

You should now be able to mount your Raspberry Pi via the address smb://your.raspberry.pi.ip/Data

You user will be pi and the password will be `raspberry` or whatever you set it to above

**Note: The Mac will often write hidden ._ files on the drive that can sometimes confuse the compiler into thinking they are source files. [Blue Harvest](http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest) is good at removing these on the fly.**
